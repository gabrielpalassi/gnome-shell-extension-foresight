Foresight is a GNOME Shell Extension that automagically opens the activities view on empty workspaces. It uses callbacks to monitor windows and workspaces (instead of actively checking on them on certain time intervals), which makes it very efficient and responsive.

## Showcase

### Switching to an empty workspace

## Getting started

### Installation

You can install Foresight using the GNOME Extensions website.

Alternatively, you can install it using the [Extension Manager](https://flathub.org/apps/com.mattjakeman.ExtensionManager) app.

### Usage

Simply keep using your desktop â€’ the magic will happen once you get to an empty workspace! There are no preferences to tweak.

Foresight will open the activities view when all windows in a workspace are closed, but also when you switch to an already empty workspace. In case the activities view was activated by Foresight, it will deactivate it once you open a window (that's GNOME default behavior) or switch to a non-empty workspace. Foresight will never deactivate the activities view if it was activated by you.

## FAQ

### How does it work?

Foresight adds callbacks to certain GNOME Shell signals, like `window-removed` and `workspace-switched`. It also keeps track of whether the activities view was activated by itself or by the user. These callbacks then check for the conditions to activate (or deactivate) the overview if needed, for example if the workspace is empty or not.

## Contributing

#### Building and installing from source

If you wish to make changes to the Foresight codebase, you will likely want to build it and install it from source. Foresight's source code on hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/pesader/gnome-shell-extension-foresight). Your first step is cloning Foresight's repository with:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pesader/gnome-shell-extension-foresight.git
```

You can then build and install the extension with:

```bash
cd gnome-shell-extension-foresight
make build && make install
```

You can run a nested session of GNOME Shell to test the extension out with:

```bash
make run
```

Before submitting a pull request, make sure you install and run both the formatter and the linter with:

```bash
npm install # install dependencies
npm run format-lint # run the formater and the linter
```

You can also have them attempt to fix the errors found with:

```bash
npm run format-lint:fix
```

To run them individually you can use:

##### Formatter

```bash
npm run format
```

```bash
npm run format:fix
```

##### Linter

```bash
npm run lint
```

```bash
npm run lint:fix
```

## Gratitude

This project would not exist if it weren't for "Show Application View When Workspace Empty" by fawtytoo, so I thank its maintainer and all its contributors. I'm also grateful to everyone in the GNOME Extensions matrix room, who kindly answered the many questions that came up while I was writing this program.
